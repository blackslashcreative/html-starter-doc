# HTML Starter Doc
A starter document that will help you quickly create an HTML page of your own.

This was the very first assignment I did through MIT, for my Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. 

### Installation
Download index.html and html.img. You can work on it locally, or upload to your web server. 

### Usage
Open index.html with a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and modify it as needed to get a quick start on your next HTML project. 

### Support
If you need help with your HTML project, you can email me here: [help@blacksla.sh](mailto:help@blacksla.sh)
